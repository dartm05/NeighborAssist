      We know that the recent Covid-19 pandemic poses a lot of challenges to our
      society and our way of life. In an effort to reduce the vulnerable
      population's exposure we decided to develop this web page to unite as a
      community and help eachother. Through our web page you can offer your help
      to someone or request someone's help all within a short distance from you.
    </h5>
    <h5>
      Connect with people who want to help or need help in just three steps:
      register, confirm and wait.
    </h5>
    <h5>1. Register the assistance you need and the location where you are.</h5>
    <h5>2. Wait for confirmation from the helper.</h5>
    <h5>3. Review the status until its complete. </h5>
